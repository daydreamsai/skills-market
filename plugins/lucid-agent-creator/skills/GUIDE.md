# Guide for Humans and Agents: Creating Lucid Agents

This guide explains the end-to-end flow for creating Lucid agents using JavaScript handlers.

## What You Get

A **working agent hosted on the Lucid platform** - no self-hosting, no deploy step. You describe what you want; your AI writes the JS handler and calls the MCP tool; the agent is created and immediately invokable.

## Flow

### 1. Set Up Your Preferred AI

Use Claude (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) or Cursor as your coding agent.

### 2. Configure the xgate MCP

Add the xgate MCP server to your AI client's MCP config. You get the **MCP URL** and **session token** from xgate.

**Normal flow (use the xgate frontend):**

1. Go to the **xgate frontend** (e.g. [xgate.run](https://xgate.run) or your local/dev UI).
2. **Connect your wallet** there. The frontend runs SIWE (Sign-In With Ethereum) for you; you sign in the wallet UI (e.g. MetaMask), no curl or manual steps.
3. xgate provisions a **server wallet** for you and exposes MCP tools. You don't create or configure that wallet yourself.
4. The frontend gives you the **MCP URL** and **session token** (or a ready-made MCP config). Add that to your client:
   - **Claude CLI / Claude Code:** `~/.claude.json` or project `.mcp.json` → `mcpServers.xgate` with `url` and `headers.Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Use the URL and token from xgate.
   - **Cursor:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json` → same `url` and `Authorization` header.

**If you're not using the frontend** (e.g. local or custom flow), you can run SIWE via the xgate API (start → challenge → sign → verify) and use the returned `sessionToken` and `walletSlug` to build the MCP URL and auth. Prefer the frontend when available.

### 3. Install the skill

**Claude (Claude Code / Claude CLI):** Add the marketplace if needed, then run:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add daydreamsai/skills-market
/plugin install lucid-agent-creator@daydreams-skills
```

**Cursor:** Copy the skill into your project — e.g. `mkdir -p .claude/skills/lucid-agent-creator` and copy `plugins/lucid-agent-creator/skills/SKILL.md` (and optionally `GUIDE.md`) from the [skills-market](https://github.com/daydreamsai/skills-market) repo into that folder.

The skill teaches the agent the JS handler code contract, `create_lucid_agent` usage, PaymentsConfig for paid agents, and optional identityConfig (ERC-8004).

### 4. Prompt Your Agent to Make an Agent

In natural language, ask your agent to create an agent. For example:
- "Create a Lucid agent that echoes input"
- "Create an agent that fetches weather by city"
- "Create a paid agent that processes data"

The agent will:
1. Use the **skill** to write the JS handler code (scope, return value, `allowedHosts` if needed)
2. Call the **`create_lucid_agent`** MCP tool with slug, name, description, and entrypoints (including that code)
3. The tool runs in xgate MCP, uses your **server wallet** for setup-payment and payment-as-auth, and calls the Lucid API to create the agent

### 5. Result

The **create_lucid_agent** tool returns the created agent as its result. You get:
- **`id`** – agent ID (e.g. `ag_771fc5c2081e`)
- **`slug`** – agent slug (e.g. `test-echo-fixed`)
- **`invokeUrl`** – full URL to invoke the first entrypoint (e.g. `https://lucid-dev.daydreams.systems/agents/{id}/entrypoints/{key}/invoke`)

Plus the rest of the agent object (`name`, `description`, `entrypoints`, etc.). The AI sees this tool result and can share it with you. No extra deploy or hosting step.

## Summary

**User** → configures xgate MCP (SIWE → server wallet) → installs lucid-agent-creator skill → prompts agent to create an agent → agent uses skill + `create_lucid_agent` → **working agent on platform**

## Notes

### Lucid API Base URL

The **Lucid API base URL** is hardcoded in the MCP server (defaults to `https://lucid-dev.daydreams.systems/api`). No configuration required; works out of the box. Can be overridden via env `LUCID_API_URL` if needed. The tool always calls that Lucid API instance; the agent never deals with URLs or endpoints.

### Paid Agents

If the agent has paid entrypoints, the **setup fee** is paid from your **server wallet** (USDC). Ensure that wallet has sufficient USDC for the one-time setup fee when creating paid agents.

### Network

All agents created via MCP use **Base network** (base-sepolia testnet). The server wallet is on Base, so all agents use Base network. Entrypoint-level network fields are not accepted.

### Identity Registration

If you include `identityConfig` with `autoRegister: true`, note that auto-registration requires an agent wallet (`walletsConfig.agent`). The MCP tool does not set this, so identity config is stored for later use. You can:
1. Add agent wallet in the dashboard
2. Retry identity registration via the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds"

Your server wallet doesn't have enough USDC. Add USDC to your server wallet and try again.

### "Agent slug already exists"

The slug you're trying to use is already taken. Try a different slug.

### "Lucid API is currently unavailable"

The Lucid API is down or unreachable. Try again later.

### "Invalid JavaScript code"

The JS handler code has syntax errors. Check your code and fix any errors.

### "Validation failed"

The input doesn't match the expected schema. Check the error details and fix the validation issues.
